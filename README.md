Among them, the disease burden data must first be processed using #the provided "download and preprocess GBD data.R" script, and then analyzed using "Pipline for GBD analysing.R" (note: "Pipline" is typically spelled "Pipeline" in standard terminology; the #original spelling is retained here as per the provided content).
